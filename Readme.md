# Steps to Execute Spark Installation Script

This guide explains how to run the Bash script that sets up and configures Apache Spark on your system.

## Step 1: Create the Script File

1. **Create a new file for the script**:
   ```bash
   vi single.sh
   ```
2. **Paste your Spark installation commands** into `single.sh`.

## Step 2: Set Permissions

1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x single.sh
   ```

## Step 3: Run the Script

1. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   sudo ./single.sh
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen prompts (if any).

## Step 4: Verify Spark Installation

1. Check if Spark services are running by using the `jps` command:
   ```bash
   jps
   ```

2. Look for processes like `Master`, `Worker`, `NameNode`, `DataNode`, and `ResourceManager`.

## Step 5: Access the Spark Web UI

- After the script completes, access the Spark Web UI by opening the following URL in your browser:
  ```
  http://localhost:8080
  ```

## Step 6: Troubleshooting

- If you encounter errors related to `conf/spark-env.sh` or missing directories:
  - Check your Spark folder structure.
  - Ensure that the download link is correct, and that the archive was extracted successfully.
  - Verify that all environment variables (like `JAVA_HOME`) are correctly set.
